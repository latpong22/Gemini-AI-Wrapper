# Gemini-AI-Wrapper
A fast and easy text only WebUI for using your Gemini API key to esaily interface and ask questions to Gemini,

You can deploy this anywhere since it only has a index.html file which can be hosted on a R2 of S3 Cloudflare/AWS Bucket. 
ALEART!!!! THIS EXPOSES YOU API KEY I DON'T CARE ABOUT EXPOSING MINE SINCE ITS A FREE ONE BUT IF YOU ARE PAYING FOR YOURS MAKE SURE TO NEVER UPLOAD IT TO THE INTERNET/HOST IT ON A BUCKET SINCE ANYONE CAN RETRIVE THE KEY ALEART!!!

This also supports prompt engnering so you can make so it does not say it was made by Google or is Gemini.

The big 4 things you have to change to make it work are Prompt engnering Message, Name, What Version of Gemini, and API key.

You can see my version at the link above. I should be unblocked by most schools.
